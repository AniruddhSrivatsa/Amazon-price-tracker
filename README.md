# Amazon-price-tracker
In this project, An Amazon product price tracker is created to montior and track the prices of the products (many products at a time) of users interest. 
User first adds the product to the tracking list and specifies the expected price for the products. Then the price is tracked using the 
Amazon link for the product using web-scraping (Beautiful soup) and the difference between the expected and the actual price is displayed to the user.

If the user uses the web-app in the future, he/she has to press the update button to get the updated/current prices of the products from the amazon webpage.
When update button is clicked, current product price is updated and the price difference between the expected and the actual are also updated.
